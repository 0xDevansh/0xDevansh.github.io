description: A poem on loss and clarity
---

I see her in the distance, standing alone\
sipping coffee, this cold winter morning.\
I'd have run over just to stand by her side,\
had it been just another day

No, today is different.\
I quietly notice her glasses fog over,\
reminiscent of the effect she had on me\
whenever I'd spend time with her.\
Now I wonder what I'd rather have,\
this clarity, or that hazy warmth?

On removing my glasses, one thing is clear,\
what I saw in her was only a mirage.\
A perfect person I wanted in my life\
to fill the holes of this hollow soul.

As I walk, my heart tugs in her direction.\
Broken things make a funny sound\
But my feet grip the ground more firmly\
as I decide to follow my own path,\
for today is different.
